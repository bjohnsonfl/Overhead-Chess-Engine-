     step 2) generate attack squares from this piece and AND them with king moveable squares
        step 2.1) Make sure the enemy king squares are not included
        step 2.2) Determine if these squares are attacked, if not, create move
     step 3) calculate how many attackers there are from step 1. if more than 1, Break, else step 4
     step 4) Determine which squares are between the king and the attacker, see if our pieces attack them, are not pinned, and thus can move there to BLOCK the check
        step 4.1) promotions count
     step 5) Determine if our pieces can capture the attacking piece, and are not pinned
